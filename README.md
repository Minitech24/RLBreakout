Reinforcement Learning for Breakout
University of Zurich  
Fall2020  
 
For this project we applied a reinforcement learning algorithm based on Deep Q Learning (DQN) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and testing various inputs to see which performed best in learning to play the game Breakout. Thereby getting a first introduction to reinforcement learning and gain deeper understanding in this very modern topic of artifical intelligence.
